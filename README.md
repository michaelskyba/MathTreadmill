In MathTreadmill, you can either train at your own pace (using "Custom" mode), or you can use "Auto" mode, which uses a pre-made path of training. It starts easy, but will get more and more difficult. The \*.4 levels are designed to be extra-difficult, so don't be discouraged if you have trouble with those.

MathTreadmill uses SQLite, Flask, CS50's python module (for easy communication with the database), and regular JavaScript


Know issues that I am too lazy to fix:
- if the user knows a bit of js, they can bypass some things like making their userame >15 chars, etc.
- if the user knows a bit of js, they can easily cheat in /auto
